    				<h1>Career and Technology Education</h1>
    			</div>
    				<p>Career and Technology Education (CTE) prepares both youth and adults for a wide range of careers. These careers require varying levels of education- from high school and postsecondary certificates, to apprenticeships, or two- and four-year college degrees. Students add value to their overall education by completing CTE programs of study that provide opportunities to earn industry-recognized credentials and college credit while still in high school.</p>
    				      <p>Career and Technical Education is a crucial part of TSA as well as the Fox Chapel Area High School cirriculum. Our school teaches many different courses based on the principles of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. STEM are very important subjects in a student's scholastic career, and provides students with the invaluable skills that can be useful in a student's future. Our school offers many STEM courses, and you can view them by clicking on their respective tabs.</p>

The advanced algebra functions include those that are linear, quadratic, absolute value, square root, cubic, higher  power polynomial, rational, exponential, and logarithmic functions. The trigonometric function study includes the six trigonometric  functions and their graphs, identities, solving trigonometric equations, radian measure, linear and angular velocity, and problem solving with real-world applications of both right triangles and oblique triangles using the laws of sines and cosines.</p>
    				          <h4>Business Calculus</h4>
    				          <p>Description: This course offers exposure to the fundamental principles of calculus regarding differentiation and integration. It may  serve as an introduction to calculus for those who later plan on taking a first course in scientific calculus, or it may be taken for the  purpose of earning college credit through the University of Pittsburgh for those planning on pursuing further studies and/or careers

    				            in business, economics, life sciences, and social sciences. The course will cover topics including: limits and their applications,  derivatives for the purpose of graphing and optimization, implicit differentiation, business concepts including marginal analysis and elasticity of demand, integration techniques, practical uses of the definite integral, and optimization of multivariable functions.</p>
    				          <h4>Calculus AB AP</h4>
    				          <p>Description: This is an advanced-level, extremely demanding, fast-paced course for students who are mathematically gifted and  highly motivated. This is an intensive study of topics in differential and integral calculus, including limits, differentiation, related  rates, implicit differentiation, Newton’s Method, particle motion, differential equations, integration, u-substitution, and solids of revolution. Emphasis is placed on a multirepresentational approach to calculus, with concepts, results, and problems being  expressed graphically, numerically, analytically, and verbally. The focus is on the application of these concepts, rather than the  manipulation or memorization of an extensive taxonomy of functions, curves, theorems, or problem types.</p>
    				          <h4>Calculus BC AP</h4>
    				          <p>Description: This is an advanced-level, extremely demanding, fast-paced course for students who are mathematically gifted and  highly motivated. It emphasizes more exhaustive problem solving. This is an intensive study of topics in differential and integral  calculus, including all topics from Calculus AB Advanced Placement, as well as techniques of integration; improper integrals;  sequence and series; and parametric, polar, and vector functions. Emphasis is placed on a multirepresentational approach to

    				            calculus, with concepts, results, and problems, being expressed graphically, numerically, analytically, and verbally. The focus  is on the application of these concepts, rather than the manipulation or memorization of an extensive taxonomy of functions, curves, theorems, or problem types.</p>
    				          <h4>Statistics AP</h4>
    				          <p>Description: This course is equivalent to an introductory, non-calculus based, college course in statistics which is typically required for college majors such as engineering, psychology, sociology, health science, and business. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the major concepts and tools for collecting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. Problem-solving

    				            application is emphasized. Topics included in the course are the organization of data, numerical descriptive measures, probability, discrete random variables and their probability distributions, continuous random variables and the normal distribution, sampling distributions, estimation of the mean and proportion, hypothesis tests about the mean and proportion, estimation and hypothesis

    				            for two populations, chi-square tests, analysis of variance, and simple linear regression.</p>
    				          <h4>Linear Algebra</h4>
    				          <p>Description: This course studies the relationships between systems of linear equations, properties of matrices and vectors, properties of vector and inner product spaces, and linear transformations. A topical outline of the course includes systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants, vectors in 2-space and 3-space, Euclidean vector spaces, general vector spaces, inner  product spaces, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, linear transformations, and applications.</p>
